# Quiz App

This app goes through different question sets. User would be able to choose correct answer. At the end, participants can see their result. If they're not satisfied with their record, they can retake test. 


## troubleshooting
**problem**

During the running the code, I realized that questions stay as default and they are not changing. Also, user wouldn't be able to retake the exam

**Solution**

I had to read the documents one more time. First I made sure the JavaScript code is correct. After carefully reading script, I checked HTML file to make sure id is correctly assigned. I realized that there were several syntax error, after correctly mispelling, questions changed to new questions.
